                        <p class="iq-title-desc">DarkCloud dedicated servers, VPS and Public Cloud instances include an IPv4 (/32) pre-configured and IPv6 IP block (/64).

                            For outstanding flexibility, users can attach up to 256 additional IPs.
                            
                            What is a floating IP? A floating IP is an additional IP that can be switched from one service to another in the same datacentre. You can also switch IPs between different datacentres, if the datacentres are located in the same country. </p>

                            <p>The key benefits of Floating IPs are:</p>

                                <p class="icon-box-desc">By adding IP blocks, you can configure multiple IP addresses to your services. You can assign IPs into groups of 4, 8, 16, or up to 256 per server, with unlimited block publications. Via the API, blocks can be separated so that you can manage your applications easily. This makes upgrades simple, as you can reroute your IP to new hardware, rather than having to reconfigure the static IP. With multiple IPs grouped into blocks, you can manage your platforms more efficiently — upgrading and migrating from one service to another with ease. IP blocks increase your control and speed, so that you can execute your business strategies and responses quickly.</p>

This means you get an uninterrupted hosting solution, and it helps you overcome issues such as hardware failure, system overruns, and other kinds of infrastructure issues. This way, if you switch from one service to another, you can keep the entire configuration linked to that IP. Floating IPs provide a solution which removes interruption or downtime if servers are overrun, and can be used in this way for “Always On” availability.</p>

                        With floating IPs, also known as failover IPs, you can create complex infrastructures that are able to withstand a wide variety of issues. For example, you can switch your existing infrastructure to a load balancer without disrupting or interrupting your customer services. Workloads can be balanced autonomously, while your online space continues as normal. There will be no noticeable IP address changes as you will always use floating IP, which means no DNS propagation delay.</p></div>

                         <p class="iq-title-desc pr-lg-5">For most online projects, hosting more than one website is a business essential. For any kind of dynamic web page — such as a blog, online store, or membership portal — it is likely that you will need an admin page as well as a public-facing website to deal with ongoing changes. Or if you support multiple languages, you will need multiple webpages. Floating IPs allow you to keep your websites on the server, but without the risk of excessive downtime or website crashes due to overloads. 

                            You can host multiple websites on a primary server by using two floating IPs. Some of your websites can be hosted on one floating IP, and the rest on another. When one server isn’t powerful enough to host the website for both the floating IPs, you can get a new server, then switch the routing of one floating IP to the new server. This relieves the primary server of the heavy workload, so it can be operational again.</p></div>

With floating IPs, you can curb the risk of downtime altogether. By following the steps to integrate a failover IP system for your projects, you can expand your infrastructure with uninterrupted performance on each of your websites

                            Importantly, floating IPs are highly customisable, and therefore can be used to solve business goals. For example, with IP Announcement services, you can announce multiple geolocations for your IP addresses. This is incredibly important for SEO optimisation, as it considerably improves the ranking of your projects in the most popular search engines.</p></div>

                     <h4>What is a failover IP?</h4>
                     <p>A failover IP, also called a floating IP, enhances service continuity (“failover”) for your applications and systems. With failover IP technology, you can switch the IP addresses from one service to another in less than a minute, with almost no service interruption for your users. This mechanism can be used during service migrations, moving projects from development to production environments, and switching services to a backup server in the event of an incident.</p>
                     <h4>How do I get an IP address?</h4>
                     <p>To use both a failover IP setup and RIPE IP, you will need to know how to get an IP address. With DarkCloud, getting an IP address is simple — log in to the DarkCloud Control Panel, and follow the appropriate steps. With a dedicated server, IPs can be configured in alias or bridge mode for virtualisation purposes.</p>
                     <h4>What is a RIPE IP address?</h4>
                    <p>A RIPE IP address is a European IP address managed and distributed by European IP Networks (Réseaux IP Européens in French). It is an open community that ensures administrative and technical conditions to maintain and develop the Internet. One of the main activities of RIPE is to allocate the IP blocks to ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and register the data in a public database, including information such as a country’s IP block ranges, current IP allocation and IP geolocation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At DarkCloud you can choose the geolocation of your RIPE IP block, and choose between 14 European countries: France, Ireland, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Finland, Lithuania, Germany and Belgium. With RIPE IP blocks, you can tailor your addressing plan to fit your needs, choosing blocks from 4 to 256 IPs and managing their reverse DNS (PTR) in the DarkCloud Control Panel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For IPs geolocated in Canada or the United States, ARIN – the American Registry for Internet Numbers – oversees the management and distribution of IP addresses. ARIN IP addresses can be used in the same way as other RIPE IPs, and can be assigned to IP blocks or used as failover IPs.</p>
