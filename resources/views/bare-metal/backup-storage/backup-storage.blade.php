                     <h2>Backup Storage for dedicated servers</h2>
                     <h4>What is a backup storage?</h4>
                     <p>A backup storage is an NFS-based storage space designed for your backups that offers 500GB space for free with all DarkCloud dedicated servers. The facility is useful for storing large amounts of data and configuration files. It also provides a space for preserving data when you need to reinstall the server. With FTP backup protocols such as NFS/CIFS you can mount your backup space locally on the server, so you are able to manipulate files as if they were on a local disk. It is also possible to automatize backups with simple scripts, pushing data to the backup storage.</p>
                     <h4>What is the difference between a backup storage and a backup server?</h4>
                     <p>Backup servers share some features with our backup storage option, but there are many key differences. With backup storage, for example, you get free 500GB of storage and the space is managed entirely by DarkCloud. You can access your backup storage files over a chosen protocol (FTP, FTPS, NFS, or CIFS) and easily upgrade up to 10TB. Access to your storage is limited to the IP address of your server, which can be one your main IP addresses or a floating IP.</p>
                     
                    <p>While they offer more backup options, backup servers require administration just like your main server. This allows you to choose how and from where you want to access your backup files and configure it to suit your needs. It's also possible to centralise data from several servers and from several datacentres. Unlike backup storage, backup servers can be accessed both from the internet and DarkCloud private network. They can also be customised for additional space, and offer guaranteed and unlimited bandwidth for your regular backups.
                    </p>
